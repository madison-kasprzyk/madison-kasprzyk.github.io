Regular expressions, or regex, extract information from text by searching for matches of a specific pattern. They can be used in almost every programming language, including Python and R. Arguably the most powerful tool in regex is findall(), which I will be talking about today. The findall() function finds ALL of the matches and returns them as a list of strings, where each string represents one match. Here are some common symbols used in regex, for your own knowledge:

Lets do some basic examples! Say we have a string of "abc aac ac acb bac a," and we want to find different matches within this string.


```{python}
import re
x="abc aac ac acb bac a"
re.findall(r"a.",x) #this will grab all instances
```

```{python}
import re
x="abc aac ac acb bac a"
re.findall(r"a+",x) #this will grab matches with 1 or more "a's"
```

```{python}
import re
x="abc aac ac acb bac a"
re.findall(r"a{2}",x) #this will grab all instances where there are two a's together
```

```{python}
import re
x="abc aac ac acb bac a"
re.findall(r"a..\s",x) #this will grab all instances that begin with a and have two letters after
```

All information written in this blog post was obtained from my computational biology professor, Nathaniel Woodward's, lectures.
