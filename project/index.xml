      <description>library(tidyverse) library(dplyr) medicaid &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;Medicaid1986.csv&amp;quot;) The dataset I am using includes data on those enrolled in Medicaid in 1986. There are 18 total variables describing the data, but I have chosen to only use 6. Ethnicity is a binary categorical variable, the two options are either &amp;quot;cauc&amp;quot; (caucasion) or &amp;quot;other&amp;quot;. School is a numerical variable, and tells the number of years of school completed ranging from 0 to 18. Income is also a numerical variable and tells the annual household income.</description>

      <description>I originally chose two datasets, one that listed the unemployment rates by county and another that listed the covid-19 rates and death rates by county. I decided to use a third dataset because I did not have enough variables, and so I picked another dataset that listed demographic data such as the proportion of a county&#39;s population that was over the age of 60 and the number of ICU beds in that county.</description>
